BhoomiMitra - Circuit Diagram Documentation
===========================================

This file provides textual descriptions of the circuit connections for the BhoomiMitra project.
Actual circuit diagrams should be created using tools like Fritzing, EasyEDA, or similar software.

1. ESP32 + Soil Moisture Sensors + Relay Module Circuit
-------------------------------------------------------

ESP32 Connections:
- 3.3V pin connects to VCC of all soil moisture sensors
- GND pin connects to GND of all soil moisture sensors and relay module
- GPIO pins 34, 35, 32, 33, 25, 26, 27, 14, 12 connect to AO (analog output) pins of the 9 soil moisture sensors
- GPIO pins 23, 22, 21, 19, 18, 5, 4, 2, 15 connect to IN1-IN9 pins of the relay module
- 5V pin connects to VCC of relay module

Relay Module Connections:
- VCC connects to ESP32 5V
- GND connects to ESP32 GND
- IN1-IN9 connect to ESP32 GPIO pins as listed above
- COM1-COM9 connect to positive terminal of power supply
- NO1-NO9 (Normally Open) connect to positive terminal of each water pump

Water Pump Connections:
- Positive terminal of each pump connects to corresponding NO terminal on relay
- Negative terminal of all pumps connect to negative terminal of power supply

Power Supply:
- 5V/12V power supply positive terminal connects to relay COM terminals
- Power supply negative terminal connects to negative terminal of all pumps
- Separate 5V USB power supply for ESP32

2. Swarm Robot Circuit (Leader Bot, Verifier Bot, Fixer Bot)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Each robot has similar connections:

Raspberry Pi / Control Board Connections:
- GPIO pins 17, 18, 22, 23 connect to IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4 of L298N motor driver
- GPIO pins 24, 25 connect to TRIG, ECHO of front ultrasonic sensor
- GPIO pins 27, 4 connect to TRIG, ECHO of rear ultrasonic sensor
- GPIO pin 12 connects to signal pin of servo motor (for seed dispenser)
- 5V pin connects to VCC of ultrasonic sensors
- GND pin connects to GND of all components
- Camera module connects to camera interface

L298N Motor Driver Connections:
- IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4 connect to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins as listed above
- OUT1, OUT2 connect to left motor
- OUT3, OUT4 connect to right motor
- 12V connects to battery positive terminal
- GND connects to battery negative terminal and Raspberry Pi GND

Ultrasonic Sensor Connections:
- VCC connects to Raspberry Pi 5V
- GND connects to Raspberry Pi GND
- TRIG, ECHO connect to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins as listed above

Servo Motor (Seed Dispenser) Connections:
- Signal pin connects to Raspberry Pi GPIO pin 12
- VCC connects to 5V
- GND connects to GND

3. Drone Integration (Conceptual)
--------------------------------

The drone would typically have its own control system, but it can be integrated with:
- Raspberry Pi or ESP32 with camera module
- GPS module for position tracking
- Communication module (WiFi/RF) to send data to the main system
- Thermal camera module connected to the processing unit

4. ArUco Marker System
---------------------

ArUco markers are printed patterns placed around the field to help robots with:
- Position identification
- Navigation waypoints
- Field boundary marking

5. Power Management
------------------

- Main control system: 5V USB power adapter or power bank
- Irrigation system: 12V power supply for pumps
- Robots: 12V LiPo batteries
- Drone: LiPo battery (typically 11.1V or 14.8V)

Notes:
- All GND connections should be common
- Use appropriate voltage regulators where needed
- Add capacitors near motors to reduce noise
- Consider adding fuses for safety
- Water-resistant enclosures should be used for outdoor components
